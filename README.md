# Aubay - Frontend Technical test

Application created to Frontend Technical teste of Aubay. Created based on my own Frontend boilerplate (https://github.com/leonardoss/santopixel-boilerplate)

- user: admin
- password: admin

##### Application created based on
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Vanilla.JS

#### How to run ####
Install node dependencies (node v8.11.4)
```
npm install
```

Run frontend (with gulp installed globally)
```
gulp
```

Build your project
```
gulp deploy
```

###  Considerations
    - I could use the HTML5 validate required, but i choosed to validate with JS 
    - My idea to expand the validators is extend the rules to something like: type-email, type-number, etc
    - If is necessary two validators in a fiels we could create a array of rules like data-validate="type-required type-email" and interate.


Thanks for the opportunity :)
